Slip 20 - A) Write Nodes application containing an event handler to open and read the contents of a file.

const fs = require('fs');

// Define the file path
const filePath = '/path/to/file.txt';

// Define the event handler function
const readFileHandler = (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return;
  }
  console.log(data);
};

// Open and read the contents of the file
fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf-8', readFileHandler);



Slip 20 - B) Using Node,js create an application that shows SY BBA(CA) course structure.

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Define a route that displays the course structure
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  const courseStructure = {
    year: 'SY',
    program: 'BBA(CA)',
    courses: [
      {
        name: 'Introduction to Operating Systems',
        credits: 3,
        prereqs: ['Introduction to Computer Science'],
        description: 'This course covers the fundamentals of operating systems, including processes, threads, memory management, and file systems.'
      },
      {
        name: 'Data Structures and Algorithms',
        credits: 4,
        prereqs: ['Introduction to Computer Science', 'Programming Fundamentals'],
        description: 'This course covers the design and analysis of algorithms, as well as common data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees.'
      },
      {
        name: 'Database Management Systems',
        credits: 3,
        prereqs: ['Introduction to Computer Science'],
        description: 'This course covers the basics of database design and management, including data modeling, SQL, and transaction management.'
      },
      // Add more courses as needed
    ]
  };
  res.json(courseStructure);
});

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started on port 3000');
});
